description = " Represents a specific occurrence of an anomaly (such as threshold 
                violations, signal deviations, or unexpected patterns) associated 
                with a particular component, equipment, or system that have been 
                detected by monitoring sensors coupled with an anomaly detection 
                algorithm. "

[relationships.detected_by]
description = " Defines a semantic relationship indicating that a detected anomaly 
                (such as a deviation from expected operational behavior) was identified 
                through the observation or analysis of a specific monitoring variable. 
                This link establishes traceability between the anomaly instance and the 
                physical variable that triggered its detection, "
