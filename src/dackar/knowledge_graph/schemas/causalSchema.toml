[node.abnormal_event]
node_description = """Represents a generic abnormal event associated with a specific equipment item, capturing any unexpected, 
                      irregular, or off-nominal condition that may impact the equipment’s performance, reliability, or safety. 
                      This node serves as a placeholder for a wide range of event types—including faults, anomalies, or 
                      operational deviations—detected through monitoring systems, reported by plant staff, or inferred from 
                      system behavior. It enables semantic linking to related entities such as condition reports, monitoring 
                      variables, failure modes, and maintenance actions, supporting diagnostics, risk assessment, and operational 
                      decision-making."""

[relation.causes]
relation_description = """Defines a directed causal relationship between two recorded events or anomaly instances, 
                          indicating that the occurrence of one event or anomaly has contributed to, triggered, or 
                          influenced the emergence of the other. This relation captures temporal and logical dependencies 
                          within operational or system behavior contexts, supporting root cause analysis, fault 
                          propagation modeling, and the construction of causal chains for diagnostics, risk assessment, 
                          and decision support."""
